"""
make_site_data.py  -  build the data layer for the interactive site (per-year structure).

Reads data/panel_all9_by_year.csv (built by build_panel_all9.py) and the ELWR/AWPE file,
and writes:
  - data.js                      (window.UCDATA = {...}; loaded by index.html at repo root)
  - data/cross_section_all9.csv  (tidy unified file for the DEFAULT pooled period)

data.js stores a per-(campus,school) panel of raw yearly counts + covariates; the site pools
across the selected year/period and computes every rate client-side (ratio-of-sums over
jointly-observed years), so years/periods are explorable just like campuses.
